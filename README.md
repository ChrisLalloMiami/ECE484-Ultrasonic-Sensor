# ECE484-Ultrasonic-Sensor
Interfacing of an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) on an Arduino Uno R3 for ECE484. For use, ensure an appropriate AVR toolchain is available on your system. Change the `path_win_avr` variable in `compile_script.py` to reflect the path to your AVR bin folder, and then run `python compile_script.py 4 com#`, where `#` is the COM port your Arduino is connected to.
